Audio Player
============

This extension for Radiant adds a Flash audio player plugin which can be embedded on the pages of your site. It adds an "Audio" tab to the admin area, where mp3 files may be uploaded. 

Suggested uses: publishing a podcast, or portfolio of music.

This is a standalone extension. It does not depend on any other asset management extensions, but neither should it cause any conflict if you do have such an extension installed.
